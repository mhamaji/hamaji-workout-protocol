# Hamaji workout Protocol

## Introduction
Hello and welcome, this  document has been created with the intent of bringing some physical stimuli for those that are locked-up during the COVID-19 quarantine.

This repository is opened for all kinds of suggestions! Open a PR if you feel so. 

## Protocol
Remember! These are just some guidelines for your workout. Every person is different with distinct bodies and fitness levels. The goal here is to find a balance between challenging and doable, that you can introduce to your routine, and progressively increase the difficulty level.

* **Warm-up**

  **WARM-UP IS MANDATORY!** Find a activity that you can keep up for at least 5 minutes. The objective here is to increase your heart rate and blood flow and with this activate your muscles and joints, protecting them for the rest of the workout.

  Examples:
  
  * High knees

## Progressions

The protocol is mainly based in bodyweight movements. The default workout is based in 4 sets of 5 reps each and a minute of rest time between sets. When you feel that the default workout isn's challenging enough you can change your settings, tweaking any of the following:
- Reps/Set
- Rest Time
- Exercise
Thinking that we have a small pool of different exercises, we may change the workout focusing in the following variables, making it more challenging in different ways.

### Variables

  * Volume

    Volume focus is when you increase the amount of reps and sets of your workout.

  * Endurance

    Endurance focus is when you prioritize lowering the amount of time needed for the workout. You reduce the amount of the resting time intervals, between sets.

  * Strength
    
    Strength focuses on prioritizing the exercise's load(Do it in a harder progression).

With these variables we can create a total of 4 different workouts:
  - Default
  - Volume
  - Endurance
  - Strength

From your default workout you can build sub-workouts oriented by the variables mentioned above.

**The chart below exemplifies how you can change variables setting different focus, for a specific exercise(Push up).**

||Volume|Endurance|Strength|Default|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Reps/Set|10|5|5|5|
|Rest time|60s|30s|60s|60s|
|Exercise|Incline push ups|Incline push ups|Knee push ups|Incline push ups|

## Split
Below is an suggestion of split that varies the stimuli through the days.
||Day 1|Day 2|Day 3|Day 4|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Main Variable|Default|Volume|Endurance|Strength|
