# Hamaji workout Protocol

## Introduction
Hello and welcome, this  document has been created with the intent of bringing some physical stimuli for those that are locked-up during the COVID-19 quarantine.

This repository is opened for all kinds of suggestions! Open a PR if you feel so. 

## Protocol
Remember! These are just some guidelines for your workout. Every person is different with distinct bodies and fitness levels. The goal here is to find a balance between challenging and doable, that you can introduce to your routine, and progressively increase the difficulty level.

* Warm-up

  **WARM-UP IS MANDATORY!** Find a activity that you can keep up for at least 5 minutes. The objective here is to increase your heart rate and blood flow and with this activate your muscles and joints, protecting them for the rest of the workout.

  Examples:
  
  * High knees

## Split
The protocol is mainly based in bodyweight movements. Thinking that we have a small pool of different exercises we can change the workout focusing in the following points.

* Resistance(Default)

  Focusing on resistance is the default workout. Think just about using the default amout of reps and sets with the default resting time.

* Endurance

  Endurance focus is when we try to make the default volume(Reps and sets) with the shortest duration possible, decreasing the amount of resting time intervals.

* Strength(Kind of...)
  
  Strength focus


## Progressions

The regimen starts with 4 sets of 5 reps for each selected exercise. When you feel that some of the selected exercises isn't challenging anymore try to change to a harder progression.
