# Hamaji workout Protocol

## Introduction
Hello and welcome, this  document has been created with the intent of bringing some physical stimuli for those that are locked-up during the COVID-19 quarantine.

This repository is opened for all kinds of suggestions! Open a PR if you feel so. 

## Protocol
Remember! These are just some guidelines for your workout. Every person is different with distinct bodies and fitness levels. The goal here is to find a balance between challenging and doable, that you can introduce to your routine, and progressively increase the difficulty level.

* **Warm-up**

  **WARM-UP IS MANDATORY!** Find a activity that you can keep up for at least 5 minutes. The objective here is to increase your heart rate and blood flow and with this activate your muscles and joints, protecting them for the rest of the workout.

  Examples:
  
  * High knees

## Progressions

The protocol is mainly based in bodyweight movements. Thinking that we have a small pool of different exercises we can change the workout focusing in the following variables:

### Variables

  * Volume

    Volume focus is when you increase the amount of reps and sets of your workout.

  * Endurance

    Endurance focus is when you prioritize lowering the amount of time needed for the workout. You reduce the amount of the resting time intervals, between sets.

  * Strength(Kind of...)
    
    Strength focuses on prioritizing the exercise's load(Doing a harder progression).

The regimen starts with 4 sets of 5 reps for each selected exercise, and a minute between sets. When you feel that the workout isn's challenging enough you can change one of the variables above.
